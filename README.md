# Project 2 - /TITLED

By [Raquel Cruickshank](https://github.com/cruickshankrpc) and [Kianna Love](https://github.com/akirakianna)

## Overview 
This was my first experience of a Hackathon and boy did I love it. Making split decisions to build under pressure and complete a final product in **48 hours** was a thrill, and I am proud of the final result.\
This was a pair-programmed project and I thoroughly enjoyed bouncing ideas off my partner who has a similar aesthetic sensibility.\
During Project 1, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, agonising over the logic to make aliens move on a grid felt trivial to say the least.\
So, for this project, Kianna and I decided to address the underrepresentation of Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups by shining a light on POC artists and other works that explore their lived experience.
