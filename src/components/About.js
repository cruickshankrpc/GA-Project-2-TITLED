      This study</a> found that <span id="statistic">85.4%</span> of the works in the collections of all major 
      US museums belong to white artists, and <span id="statistic">87.4%</span> are by men. African American 
      artists have the lowest share with just <span id="statistic">1.2%</span> of the works; Asian artists 
      total at <span id="statistic">9%</span>; and Hispanic and Latino artists constitute only <span id="statistic">2.8%</span> of the 
      artists.</p>
    <p className="text-edit">We believe that diversity matters. This is a space to champion the talents of POC artists.</p>
